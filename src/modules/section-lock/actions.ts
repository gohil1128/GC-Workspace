  Section lock.

  One 4-digit PIN for the business, and a list of which sections sit behind it.

  a PIN per section — is three PINs nobody remembers and writes on the till.

  This started as a recipes-only lock; the PIN column was renamed rather than
  replaced so existing PINs keep working, and the migration carries anyone who
  had one over to lockedSections = ['RECIPES'].
