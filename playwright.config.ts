  End-to-end tests for the things that are expensive to get wrong: who can see
  what, whether a locked section stays locked, and whether the cash arithmetic
  moves by the amount it should.

  These were all verified by hand while the bugs were being fixed. Committing
  them is what stops the same bugs coming back — every one of the section-lock
  failures they cover shipped to production and sat there unnoticed.

  Expects a built app already running at BASE_URL against a seeded database.
